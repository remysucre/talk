abstract = {The performance of analytical query processing in data management systems depends primarily on the capabilities of the system's query optimizer. Increased data volumes and heightened interest in processing complex analytical queries have prompted Pivotal to build a new query optimizer.In this paper we present the architecture of Orca, the new query optimizer for all Pivotal data management products, including Pivotal Greenplum Database and Pivotal HAWQ. Orca is a comprehensive development uniting state-of-the-art query optimization technology with own original research resulting in a modular and portable optimizer architecture.In addition to describing the overall architecture, we highlight several unique features and present performance comparisons against other systems.},

abstract = {Not all queries in relational calculus can be answered “sensibly” once disjunction, negation, and universal quantification are allowed. The class of relational calculus queries, or formulas, that have “sensible” answers is called the domain independent class, which is known to be undecidable. Subsequent research has focused on identifying large decidable subclasses of domain independent formulas In this paper we investigate the properties of two such classes the evaluable formulas and the allowed formulas. Although both classes have been defined before, we give simplified definitions, present short proofs of their man properties, and describe a method to incorporate equality.Although evaluable queries have sensible answers, it is not straightforward to compute them efficiently or correctly. We introduce relational algebra normal form for formulas from which form the correct translation into relational algebra is trivial. We give algorithms to transform an evaluable formula into an equivalent allowed formula, and from there into relational algebra normal form. Our algorithms avoid use of the so-called Dom relation, consisting of all constants appearing in the database or the query.Finally, we describe a restriction under which every domain independent formula is evaluable, and argue that evaluable formulas may be the largest decidable subclass of the domain independent formulas that can be efficiently recognized.},
